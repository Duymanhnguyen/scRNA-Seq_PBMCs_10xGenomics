# Single-cell Transcriptomics of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells 

## Overview

This project performs a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) using outputs generated by 10x Genomics and processed through the Seurat package in R. The main goal is to identify transcriptionally distinct cell types within the PBMCs sample, explore cellular heterogeneity, and detect rare immune populations that are often masked in bulk transcriptomic data. This repository contains scripts, analysis results, and figures derived from the project. Partial results of this project are integrated into the research **"Effect of Chronic Stress on Whole Blood Transcriptome: A Meta-Analysis of Publicly Available Datasets from Rodent Models"** by **Dr. Elizabeth Flandreau** at **Grand Rapids University** and **Dr. Megan Hagenauer** at **University of Michigan - Ann Arbor**.

### Project History 

This scRNA-Seq project was adapted from a [publicly available pipeline](https://github.com/quadbio/scRNAseq_analysis_vignette) developed by Dr. Zhisong He and Prof. Barbara Treutlein, designed to work with 10x Genomics data using Seurat. The pipeline was customized and extended by **Duy Nguyen**, a Biological Chemistry and Statistics major at Grinnell College, to perform downstream clustering, annotation, and visualization of PBMCs dataset as part of an independent research project, along with the support of other two Grinnell students, **Minh Nguyen** and **Hannah Kim**.

### Data Collection

The [dataset](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/5k_Mouse_PBMCs_5p_gem-x) was generated from PBMCs of C57BL/6J mice using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform. The Seurat package in R was used to perform preprocessing, quality control, normalization, dimension reduction, and clustering.

### Analysis Workflow 

- **1. Import Raw Data and Create Seurat Object**
  
  - Expression data, cell barcodes, and gene features were imported and combined into a Seurat object. Mitochondrial transcript percentages were calculated, and cells with missing metadata were removed.

- **2. Quality Control**
  
  - Cells were filtered based on transcript counts, number of detected genes, and mitochondrial content to exclude dead or low-quality cells.

- **3. Normalization**
  
  - Gene expression values were normalized to account for sequencing depth and other technical variations.

- **4. Feature Selection**
  
  - Highly variable genes across the dataset were identified to capture biological heterogeneity.

- **5. Scaling**
  
  - The data was scaled to remove the effects of technical noise and prepare for dimensionality reduction.

- **6. Linear Dimension Reduction (PCA)**
  
  - PCA was used to reduce dimensionality and identify major sources of variation.

- **7. Non-linear Dimension Reduction (t-SNE and UMAP)**
  
  - t-SNE and UMAP embeddings were generated for visualizing the dataset in two dimensions, preserving local structure and heterogeneity.

- **8. Cell Clustering and Annotation**
  
  - Cells were grouped into clusters using graph-based methods, and clusters were annotated using canonical marker genes to assign biological identity.
